# Plastic SCM Guide
This guide will try to help you with setting up Plastic SCM and start using it within our team's guidelines.
# Getting Started

## Installation

First of all, please create an account at https://www.plasticscm.com/account/register with your company email (@twentythree.com.tr).

After creating and verifying your account, ask your Plastic SCM administrator for an invite to your team's organization by providing your email.

When your account is ready, you can download Plastic SCM Client from https://www.plasticscm.com/download .

Run the installer.

In component selection screen, you can unselect **Server components**. For integrations, you can select your IDEs and Office softwares as you wish.
**It is recommended to leave IntelliJ integrations unchecked, since they seem to affect your IDE's performance significantly still as of 16/04/21**

After you are done installing, the first time you launch Plastic SCM, Plastic's Client Configuration Wizard will run. Login with your email and password. After logging in, you are asked to select an organization. If your administrator successfully added you to your team's organization, you should see your organization in this list. Select it and click Join.

Client Configuration Wizard will as for if you want to use Gluon or classic version. Gluon is a simplified version of Plastic SCM client for non-technical folks (those artsy types) in your team. Pick your poison. You can change it later.
